## Welcome to ECSE 321 Group 14's project!

## About

The tutoring  company will accomplish the needs of students at the high school, CÉGEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. 

Our software solution implements the tutor point of view. Features include applying for a position, login in to an account, setting hourly rates and availabilities, viewing other tutors, accepting a student's request for a tutoring session and reviewing a student after a session. 

Tools that were used include: Eclipse, Spring Boot, Gradle, UML Lab, Heroku, Draw.io & LucidChart, Vue.js, Bootstrap
