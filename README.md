## About

The tutoring  company will accomplish the needs of students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. Our group mainly focuses on the tutor point of view. Keeping this mind, the first deliverable includes:

1. List of functional and nonfunctional requirements
2. User Case Diagram
3. UML Diagram (Domain Model)
4. Persistence Layer

Tools that were used in this deliverable include: Eclipse, SpringBoot, Gradle, UML Lab, Heroku, Draw.Io
